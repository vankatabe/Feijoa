##Teamwork Project Assignment for the blog

Assignmnent: https://softuni.bg/downloads/svn/qa-automation/03.%20QA-Automation-Selenium-Advanced/03.%20QA-Automation-Selenium-WebDriver-Advanced-Exercises.docx or see \Documentation folder

In the documentation, Use Cases were written in Gherkin language. Some tests were written in gherkin as well, using SpecFlow framework.

Please see a list of all the implemented features in: \Documentation\SoftUni-QA_Automation-BlogProject-Feijoa-Features.pptx (https://github.com/vankatabe/Feijoa/blob/master/Documentation/SoftUni-QA_Automation-BlogProject-Feijoa-Features.pptx)

1. The project assignment is roughly the following:
- Create SRS, Test Plan and Test Scenarios and Test Cases to fully test a sample Blog
website
- Implement test automation with Selenium Webdriver test framework
- Use a Page Object Model
- Use data-driven approach for test input data using an xls file
- Set up continuous integration with Team City
- the assignment could be found here:
https://github.com/vankatabe/Feijoa/blob/master/Documentation/QA-Automation-Teamwork-Assignment-March-2017.docx

2. The project was implemented as follows:
- on MS Visual Studio 2015 in C# language using NUnit test framework, Selenium Webdriver
and the sample Blog website itself is within the project.
- other automation tools / approaches have been used for test reporting - see
https://github.com/vankatabe/Feijoa/blob/master/Blog.UI.Tests/TestsRun.bat and their
final product is several TestResult.htm/html/txt files in Blog.UI.Tests directory. Also,
there are txt and jpg files in \Logs dir.

3. All developed and implemented features' brief description can be seen in the pptx
presentation at:
https://github.com/vankatabe/Feijoa/blob/master/Documentation/SoftUni-QA_Automation-BlogProject-Feijoa-Features.pptx
- some of the features were video-demonstrated at:
https://github.com/vankatabe/Feijoa/blob/master/README.md

4. Volume of work: The project was primarily developed by me, as the skeleton and framework for all the features and templates all the documents were developed 100% by me.
My colleague got into the project at a later stage and was assigned, under my supervision, only to enrich the test cases and code using the templates developed by me.
I can evaluate my contribution as follows:
- SRS, Test Plan, Test Scenarios, Presentation: 95%
- Test Cases - 70% of total count
- Gherkin (SpecFlow) tests - 100%
- Page Object Model - 100%
- Data-Driven Model - 100%
- Test code framework - 100%
- Tests architecture - 100%
- Test templates for each page - 100%
- Tests automated reporting - several different types of reports created - 100%
- Continuous Integration server set-up and running - 100%
- GitHub and Waffle.io set-up - 100%

Another similar project of mine (just without documentation) could be seen at:

Being really passionate about automation, I went beyond the Blog test assignment requirements.
